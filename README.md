üåü Project Overview
This project aims to build an accurate and interpretable machine learning model for diabetes prediction using the PIMA Indians Diabetes Dataset. The pipeline includes:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with Seaborn and Plotly.
Data Cleaning and Imputation for missing values.
Feature Engineering and Scaling.
Model training using PyCaret, including:
Logistic Regression
Random Forest
CatBoost
Gradient Boosting
Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
Advanced techniques like model stacking and blending.
Model evaluation using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
üìä Dataset Description
The dataset used is the PIMA Indians Diabetes Dataset, commonly used for binary classification tasks. It contains the following features:

Feature	Description
Pregnancies	Number of times the patient has been pregnant
Glucose	Plasma glucose concentration
BloodPressure	Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
SkinThickness	Triceps skinfold thickness (mm)
Insulin	2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
BMI	Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
DiabetesPedigreeFunc	Diabetes pedigree function (genetic predisposition)
Age	Age of the patient (years)
Outcome	Binary target variable (1 = Diabetes, 0 = No Diabetes)
üîç Features and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Key steps in EDA include:

Missing Value Analysis:

Visualized using missingno matrix and imputed with feature means for zero values.
Class Distribution:

Donut pie chart showing the ratio of diabetic vs. non-diabetic patients.
Feature Distribution:

Histograms for each feature, segmented by diabetes outcome.
Correlation Heatmap:

Showcasing feature correlations to identify multicollinearity.
UMAP for Dimensionality Reduction:

2D and 3D UMAP projections for visualizing separability between classes.
ü§ñ Modeling Approach
The project implements the following machine learning techniques:

Baseline Models:

Logistic Regression, Random Forest, LDA, Gradient Boosting, CatBoost.
Model Tuning:

Hyperparameter optimization using PyCaret‚Äôs tune_model function.
Model Stacking:

Combining top 5 models using stacking for improved performance.
Model Blending:

Soft and hard blending for robust predictions.
Calibration:

Probability calibration using PyCaret‚Äôs calibrate_model method.
Final Model:

The best-performing model finalized and evaluated.
üìà Results
Performance metrics for the final model include:

Metric	Value
Accuracy	0.87
Precision	0.85
Recall	0.83
F1-Score	0.84
